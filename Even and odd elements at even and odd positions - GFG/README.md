# Even and odd elements at even and odd positions
## Easy
<div class="problems_problem_content__Xm_eO"><p><span style="font-size:18px">Given an array <strong>arr[] </strong>of size <strong>N</strong>,the task is to arrange the array such that odd elements occupy the odd positions and even elements occupy the even positions. The order of elements must remain the same. Consider zero-based indexing. After printing according to conditions, if remaining,&nbsp;print the remaining elements as it is.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Example 1:</strong></span></p>

<pre><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Input: </strong>N = 6
arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
<strong>Output:</strong> 2 1 4 3 6 5
<strong>Explanation</strong>: Even elements are at 
even position and odd elements are 
at odd position keeping the order 
maintained.

This is a function problem. You don't need to take any input, as it is already accomplished by the driver code. You just need to complete the function <strong>arrangeOddAndEven</strong>() that takes array<strong> arr</strong>[] and size <strong>N</strong> as parameters and returns an array according to the above-mentioned condition.</span></p>
